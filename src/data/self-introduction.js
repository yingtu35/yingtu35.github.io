  `My name is Ying Tu, I am a computer science graduate student at University of Southern California.
  I have a vision of creating useful applications and making positive impacts on the world.`,

  `I made a transition from chemical engineering into computer science in late 2021 because I notice 
  the unlimited potential computer science could contribute to the humanity. With full passion, I started my
  journey as a junior programmer, and began building projects one by one. I accumulated various knowledge and skills
  along the path, specifically in full-stack development and software engineering.`,

  `I am actively seeking internship opportunities for summer 2024, I believe I can bring what I have into wherever I go, and grow to become a better software engineer while
  helping others as well!`,
